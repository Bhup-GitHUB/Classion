## 💡 What is Classion?

Classion is a SaaS platform that gives coding bootcamps and tech educators everything they need to run their online business — all in one place.

Instead of paying for Zoom + Vimeo + AWS + Teachable + multiple other tools, you get everything unified under your own brand.

---

## 🎯 The Problem

Right now, running an online coding bootcamp means:

- Using 8-10 different tools that don't talk to each other
- Spending $500-1000/month on subscriptions
- Students jumping between multiple platforms
- Needing developers just to keep things running
- Looking unprofessional with "Powered by XYZ" everywhere

**Classion solves all of this.**
